# Svelte + Vite + xstate + PWA + TailwindCSS

I have followed [Vite PWA guide](https://vite-plugin-pwa.netlify.app/) because the example is with [Routify](https://www.routify.dev/) and I wanted to experimentate with [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/) as a way of handling the current page.

The master branch is Svelte + Vite + xstate + PWA
The tailwind branch adds TailwindCSS

Let me know any error.
